## Cross-Phase Integration

### Broken Links

| From | To | Issue | Impact |
|------|----|-------|--------|
| header.tsx:23 `href="#work"` | work-section.tsx:39 `id="our-work"` | Anchor mismatch | Header "Our Work" nav link does not scroll to section |

**Fix:** Change header.tsx line 23 from `href: "#work"` to `href: "#our-work"`

### Verified Links

- Header `#about` → about-section `id="about"` ✓
- Header `#services` → services-accordion `id="services"` ✓
- Header `#contact` → contact-section `id="contact"` ✓
- Hero CTA `#contact` → contact-section `id="contact"` ✓
- Footer `#about` → about-section ✓
- Footer `#our-work` → work-section ✓
- Footer `#testimonials` → testimonials-section ✓
- Footer `#faq` → faq-section ✓
- Footer `#services` → services-accordion ✓
- Footer `#contact` → contact-section ✓
- All components imported and rendered in page.tsx ✓
- Layout wraps header + main + footer ✓
- Client/server component boundaries correct ✓

**Integration: 19/20 points verified**

## E2E User Flows

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Landing → scroll through all sections | PASS |
| 2 | Click header "About" → scrolls to About | PASS |
| 3 | Click header "Services" → scrolls to Services | PASS |
| 4 | Click header "Our Work" → scrolls to Work | FAIL (broken anchor) |
| 5 | Click header "Contact" → scrolls to Contact | PASS |
| 6 | Click hero CTA "Get in Touch" → scrolls to Contact | PASS |
| 7 | Mobile: hamburger → link → menu closes + scrolls | PASS |
| 8 | Fill contact form → validates → shows success | PASS |
| 9 | FAQ accordion expand/collapse | PASS |
| 10 | Services accordion expand/collapse with sticky image | PASS |

**Flows: 9/10 passing**

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 7 | Placeholder SVG hero image | Info (intentional) |
| 8 | Reuses hero-placeholder.svg for services | Info (intentional) |
| 9 | Project images are white boxes with text | Info (intentional) |
| 10 | Contact form has no backend | Info (out of scope) |

**4 items across 4 phases — all intentional placeholders or deferred scope.**

## Conclusion

**Status: gaps_found** — 1 broken navigation link prevents full milestone completion.

The gap is a single-line fix: change `href="#work"` to `href="#our-work"` in header.tsx line 23. All other integration points, requirements, and user flows pass.
