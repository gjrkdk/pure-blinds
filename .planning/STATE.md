## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1]: Port reference design to Next.js - existing Vite/React reference code provides proven layout/animation patterns; adapt for Next.js App Router + Tailwind v4
- [v1.1]: Placeholder content over real copy - ship design structure first, fill actual business copy separately to avoid blocking on copywriting
- [v1.1]: Structure-first for blog/FAQ - ship page shells now, fill content separately

### Pending Todos

From v1.0 carried forward:
- Add Phase 3 verification documentation (process gap from v1.0 audit)
- Create test products in Shopify store (deferred from Phase 1)
- Add unit tests for pricing calculator and cart store actions
- Pricing matrix reference in Draft Order custom attributes (ORDER-04 deferred from v1.0)

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
