<objective>
Replace the existing Value Props (#about) and Product Showcase (#services) sections on the homepage with a proper About section (label, heading, description, 4-stat grid) and a What We Do section (expandable accordion with sticky sidebar image).

Purpose: Visitors learn about the business and available services through structured, interactive content.
Output: Two new homepage section components replacing the placeholder sections, with accordion interactivity for services.

Key codebase facts:
- Homepage: src/app/page.tsx (server component, imports Link and Image from next)
- Current #about section (lines 136-162): Value Props with 3 items in grid
- Current #services section (lines 164-196): Product Showcase with 4 use-case cards
- Design system: monochrome colors (text-foreground, text-muted, bg-background, bg-surface, border-border, bg-accent)
- Typography: uppercase tracking-widest labels, font-light headings (text-3xl/text-4xl), text-sm body
- Spacing: px-6 mobile, max-w-5xl containers, py-20 section padding
- Pattern from 06-01: Client component for interactive parts, server component for static
- Pattern from 07-01: SVG placeholder for images (self-contained repo)
- Section IDs must remain id="about" and id="services" (linked from header/footer nav)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create About section with stats grid</name>
  <files>src/components/home/about-section.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/home/about-section.tsx` as a server component (no 'use client' needed — purely static content).

**Component structure:**
- Section wrapper with `id="about"` and consistent padding (px-6 py-20 sm:py-28)
- Max-width container (max-w-5xl mx-auto)
- Label: small uppercase tracking-widest text-muted paragraph (e.g., "About Us")
- Heading: text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-light tracking-tight text-foreground (e.g., "Crafting custom textiles with precision and care")
- Description: text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed text-muted, max-w-2xl (2-3 sentences of placeholder text about the business)
- Stats grid below the text, with mt-16 spacing
- Grid: 4 columns on lg (grid-cols-4), 2 on sm (grid-cols-2), 1 on mobile
- Each stat item has: number (text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-light text-foreground), label (text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-foreground mt-2), description (text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted mt-1)
- Placeholder stats: "15+" / "Years Experience" / "Serving customers since 2009", "10K+" / "Happy Customers" / "Across Europe and beyond", "50+" / "Fabric Options" / "Premium materials to choose from", "24h" / "Turnaround" / "Quick production on most orders"
- Add a top border (border-t border-border) to the section for visual separation from hero, matching the existing monochrome design

**Update `src/app/page.tsx`:**
- Add `import { AboutSection } from '@/components/home/about-section'`
- Replace the entire Value Props section (the `<section id="about" ...>` block, lines 136-162) with `<AboutSection />`
- Keep the section id="about" INSIDE the component (not on the page level)
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — must exit 0 with no errors. Grep page.tsx for `AboutSection` import and usage. Grep about-section.tsx for `id="about"` and 4 stat items.</verify>
  <done>About section renders with label, heading, description paragraph, and 4-item stats grid. Section has id="about" for navigation. Build passes.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Services accordion with sticky image</name>
  <files>src/components/home/services-accordion.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/home/services-accordion.tsx` as a client component ('use client' — needs useState for accordion toggle).

**Component structure:**
- Section wrapper with `id="services"` and consistent padding (px-6 py-20 sm:py-28)
- Max-width container (max-w-5xl mx-auto)
- Label: small uppercase tracking-widest text-muted paragraph (e.g., "What We Do")
- Heading: text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-light tracking-tight text-foreground (e.g., "Services tailored to your needs")
- Below heading, a two-column layout on desktop (lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-16, mt-12):
  - Left column: accordion items
  - Right column: sticky image (lg:sticky lg:top-28 lg:self-start)

**Accordion implementation:**
- Use `useState<number | null>(0)` — first item open by default, null means all closed
- Define a SERVICES array at module level with 4-5 items, each with `title` and `description` (placeholder text):
  - "Custom Curtains" / description about made-to-measure curtains
  - "Room Dividers" / description about space partitioning
  - "Commercial Displays" / description about banners and signage
  - "Event Decoration" / description about event textiles
  - "Flags & Banners" / description about custom flags
- Each accordion item is a div with:
  - A button spanning full width (flex justify-between items-center py-5 border-b border-border, text-left)
  - Title text: text-base sm:text-lg font-medium text-foreground
  - Plus/minus icon on the right: a simple SVG or text character (+/-) that rotates/changes when open. Use a small SVG with two lines forming a + that transitions to - when expanded (the horizontal line stays, vertical line rotates to 0 via CSS transition: `transition-transform duration-300`, `rotate-90` when open)
  - When clicked, toggle: if this index is already open, set null; otherwise set this index
  - Description panel: conditionally rendered (or use grid-rows-[0fr]/grid-rows-[1fr] with overflow-hidden for smooth transition). The simpler approach: render the description div with a max-height transition. Use a wrapper div with `overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300` and conditional `max-h-0` (closed) vs `max-h-40` (open) plus `py-4` padding when open.
  - Description text: text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted

**Sticky image (right column):**
- Only visible on lg+ screens (hidden on mobile, the two-column grid handles this — on mobile it stacks with accordion first, image below)
- Use next/image with a placeholder SVG. Create the image inline as an SVG data URI or reference the existing `/hero-placeholder.svg` (reuse existing placeholder for now — consistent with 07-01 decision)
- Image container: aspect-[3/4] or aspect-[4/5] w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg (subtle rounding to differentiate from hero)
- `lg:sticky lg:top-28` makes it stick while scrolling the accordion on the left

**Update `src/app/page.tsx`:**
- Add `import { ServicesAccordion } from '@/components/home/services-accordion'`
- Replace the entire Product Showcase section (the `<section id="services" ...>` block, lines 164-196) with `<ServicesAccordion />`
- Remove the USE_CASES constant from page.tsx (lines 4-29) since it's no longer needed
- Keep the section id="services" INSIDE the component (not on the page level)
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — must exit 0 with no errors. Grep services-accordion.tsx for `'use client'`, `useState`, `id="services"`, and at least 4 service items. Grep page.tsx for `ServicesAccordion` import. Verify USE_CASES constant is removed from page.tsx.</verify>
  <done>Services section renders with "What We Do" label, heading, expandable accordion (first item open by default), and sticky image on desktop. Clicking an accordion item toggles its description. Section has id="services" for navigation. Build passes. Old USE_CASES constant removed.</done>
</task>

3. Old Value Props section (inline array of 3 items) is gone from page.tsx
4. Old Product Showcase section (USE_CASES map) is gone from page.tsx
5. Section IDs `id="about"` and `id="services"` still exist (inside new components) for header/footer navigation
6. about-section.tsx has 4 stat items with numbers/labels
7. services-accordion.tsx has 'use client', useState, and at least 4 service items
8. services-accordion.tsx has sticky image container with lg:sticky
