# Feature Research: Website Structure & SEO

**Domain:** Custom textile e-commerce supporting pages and SEO infrastructure
**Researched:** 2026-02-01
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Feature Landscape

### Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features users assume exist. Missing these = product feels incomplete or unprofessional.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Homepage with value proposition | First impression and entry point for organic traffic | MEDIUM | Must communicate what you sell within seconds; include hero, product highlights, trust signals. For custom products, self-segmentation ("Shop by Room", "Shop by Size") is critical. |
| Dedicated cart page | Conversion best practice for reviewing full order | LOW | Despite cart overlay existing, dedicated page provides space for upsells, trust elements, and is standard in European e-commerce. Better for complex/custom products. |
| Order confirmation/thank you page | Expected post-checkout; legal requirement in NL | MEDIUM | Must show order number, items, total, ETA, next steps. Opportunity for post-purchase engagement (social share, account creation, related products). |
| Privacy policy | GDPR requirement for EU | LOW | Must detail data collection, usage, retention, third-party sharing, customer rights. Non-compliance = up to €20M or 4% global revenue. Template-based but must be accurate. |
| Terms & conditions | Legal protection and user expectations | LOW | Standard for e-commerce; defines usage rights, liabilities, dispute resolution. |
| Shipping & returns policy | Legally required in NL (14-day cooling-off period) | LOW | Must explicitly state 14-day return window, evaluation vs usage rules, exceptions (custom/personalized items). Information must be in confirmation email, not just website. |
| Contact page with form | Trust signal and support access | LOW | Email, phone (if offered), business address, form with name/email/message. Spam protection via reCAPTCHA. |
| FAQ page | Self-service support; reduces tickets 30-40% | MEDIUM | Organized by category, uses real customer questions, implements FAQ schema for rich snippets. Major SEO benefit for long-tail keywords. |
| Basic SEO foundation (meta, OG) | Expected for shareability and search visibility | MEDIUM | Title tags (50-60 chars), meta descriptions (120-160 chars), OG tags for social sharing. Next.js Metadata API handles this cleanly. |
| XML sitemap | Standard for search engine discoverability | LOW | Next.js can generate programmatically. Submit to Google Search Console. Include all commercial pages (product, cart, policies). |
| Robots.txt | Search engine crawling guidance | LOW | Standard file; defines what bots can/cannot crawl. |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that set the product apart. Not required, but valuable for conversion or SEO.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Blog with SEO-optimized content | 43% of e-commerce traffic from organic search; blog drives long-tail keywords | HIGH | Articles about curtain care, room design, measuring guides. Build topical authority. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust) is critical in 2026 - real experience beats corporate content. |
| JSON-LD structured data | Rich snippets in search results; AI overview inclusion | MEDIUM | Product schema (price, availability), FAQ schema, BreadcrumbList, Organization. Not auto-generated by Next.js - manual implementation required. |
| Dynamic OG images | Better social media engagement when shared | MEDIUM | Next.js ImageResponse for dynamic product pages. 1200x630px recommended. Increases click-through from social shares. |
| Post-purchase upsells on thank you page | Average cart value increase; utilizes high-intent moment | MEDIUM | Order-aware recommendations, next-order coupon, account creation prompt. Track with UTMs for measurement. |
| Multi-language support (EN + NL) | Broader European market reach | HIGH | Not essential for MVP but valuable for Netherlands market serving both Dutch natives and expats/tourists. Consider for v1.x. |
| Live chat or chatbot | 88% more likely to repurchase after positive service experience | MEDIUM | Handles FAQs, pre-purchase questions about custom sizing. AI can reduce support costs 30-45% in 2026. Consider for post-MVP. |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features that seem good but create problems or are premature for current stage.

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| User accounts and login | "Professional" e-commerce sites have them | Adds complexity, friction, GDPR obligations without value for custom one-off purchases. GDPR 2026 guidance emphasizes not requiring accounts unnecessarily. | Guest checkout only for now. Add accounts later if repeat purchase data justifies it. Offer account creation on thank you page (opt-in). |
| Real-time inventory sync | Seems "modern" and prevents overselling | Irrelevant for custom-made products. Adds unnecessary complexity. | Display production lead time instead (e.g., "Ships in 5-7 business days"). |
| Complex filtering/search | Expected on large product catalogs | You have ONE product type (custom textiles). Over-engineering. | Simple category navigation or room-based segmentation on homepage is sufficient. |
| Newsletter signup modal/popup | List building for marketing | Annoying for first-time visitors; damages conversion. GDPR requires clear consent. | Footer signup form is sufficient. Consider post-purchase signup (already have email, can add to list with consent). |
| Product comparison feature | Helps users decide between options | Only useful with multiple distinct products. Current focus is custom configurations of single product type. | N/A - not applicable yet. |
| Wishlist functionality | "Standard" e-commerce feature | Low value for custom products (configurations not saved SKUs). Adds auth complexity. | Defer until multiple standard products exist. |

### Dependency Notes

- **SEO Foundation is foundational**: Meta tags, OG, sitemap must be in place before expecting organic traffic benefit from blog or other content pages.
- **Policy pages block launch**: Cannot legally operate EU e-commerce without Privacy Policy and proper returns information.
- **FAQ reduces contact volume**: Implement before or alongside contact form to deflect common questions.
- **Blog is high-effort**: Requires content creation workflow. Defer until core pages are complete and generating traffic.
- **Thank you page depends on checkout**: Shopify checkout flow must redirect to custom thank you page (not Shopify default).

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (This Milestone - v1.1)

Minimum to credibly operate and be discovered organically.

- [x] Homepage with value proposition, product highlights, trust signals
- [x] Dedicated cart page (complement to existing overlay)
- [x] Order confirmation/thank you page (basic - order details + next steps)
- [x] Privacy policy (GDPR-compliant)
- [x] Terms & conditions
- [x] Shipping & returns policy (Netherlands 14-day law)
- [x] Contact page with form
- [x] FAQ page (structure + 10-15 common questions)
- [x] SEO meta tags (title, description, OG) on all pages
- [x] XML sitemap generation
- [x] Robots.txt

**Rationale**: These are non-negotiable for legal compliance (GDPR, NL consumer law), organic discoverability (SEO basics), and user trust (policies, contact, FAQ). Without these, site appears incomplete and risks regulatory penalties.

### Add After Core Pages Live (v1.2-1.3)

Features to add once foundation is validated.

- [ ] Blog structure (listing + post template) - Priority after monitoring organic traffic gaps
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data for product pages - Enhances existing product page SEO
- [ ] Dynamic OG images for product configurations - Improves social sharing
- [ ] Enhanced thank you page with upsells/account creation - Conversion optimization
- [ ] FAQ schema markup - Targets rich snippets

**Trigger for adding**:
- Blog: When keyword research shows content opportunities or organic traffic plateaus
- JSON-LD: After 2-4 weeks of basic SEO to measure baseline
- Dynamic OG: When social media becomes traffic source
- Thank you enhancements: After 50+ orders to validate patterns

### Future Consideration (v2+)

Features to defer until product-market fit and traffic validate need.

- [ ] Multi-language (EN/NL) - Wait for market data on language preference
- [ ] Live chat/chatbot - Needs support ticket volume to justify
- [ ] User accounts - Only if repeat purchase rate justifies complexity
- [ ] Blog content calendar and regular publishing - Resource-intensive, needs content strategy
- [ ] Advanced SEO (technical audits, backlink strategy) - After core content is indexed

**Why defer**: These require ongoing effort (blog content), significant development (multi-language, accounts), or solve problems that may not exist yet (chat for low support volume).

## Feature Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | User Value | Implementation Cost | Priority | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|-------|
| Privacy policy | HIGH | LOW | P1 | Legal requirement, template-based |
| Shipping/returns policy | HIGH | LOW | P1 | Legal requirement (NL 14-day law) |
| Terms & conditions | HIGH | LOW | P1 | Legal protection |
| SEO meta tags | HIGH | LOW | P1 | Next.js Metadata API makes this straightforward |
| XML sitemap | HIGH | LOW | P1 | Next.js generates; submit to Search Console |
| Homepage | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 | Primary entry point for organic traffic |
| FAQ page | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 | Reduces support load, SEO benefit |
| Cart page | MEDIUM | LOW | P1 | Table stakes; complements overlay |
| Thank you page | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P1 | Post-checkout expectation |
| Contact page | MEDIUM | LOW | P1 | Trust signal, support access |
| Robots.txt | MEDIUM | LOW | P1 | Standard SEO practice |
| Blog structure | MEDIUM | HIGH | P2 | Content investment required |
| JSON-LD structured data | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P2 | Manual per page type |
| Dynamic OG images | LOW | MEDIUM | P2 | Nice-to-have for sharing |
| Thank you page upsells | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P2 | Conversion optimization |
| FAQ schema markup | LOW | LOW | P2 | Incremental SEO boost |
| Multi-language | LOW | HIGH | P3 | Wait for market validation |
| Live chat | LOW | MEDIUM | P3 | Premature without support volume |
| User accounts | LOW | HIGH | P3 | Unnecessary for custom one-off purchases |

**Priority key:**
- **P1**: Must have for this milestone - legal, trust, or core SEO
- **P2**: Should have soon - enhances SEO or conversion
- **P3**: Nice to have - future optimization or unvalidated assumptions

## European/Dutch Market Considerations

### Legal Compliance (Non-Negotiable)

1. **GDPR Requirements (EU-wide)**
   - Privacy policy must detail: data collected, purposes, retention, third-party sharing, user rights
   - Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous (no pre-checked boxes)
   - Reject button must be as prominent as Accept
   - Penalties: Up to €20M or 4% global revenue
   - Contact form must include data usage policy

2. **Netherlands Distance Selling Act**
   - 14-day cooling-off period for online purchases (starts day after delivery)
   - Customers can evaluate but not use products during this period
   - Exceptions: Custom/personalized items (seal broken), hygiene products, tickets
   - Must inform customers of exceptions BEFORE purchase
   - Order confirmation must be sent via email/letter (not just on-site)
   - Penalties: Up to €900,000 from ACM (Dutch consumer authority)

3. **Upcoming Changes**
   - "Empowerment of consumers in green transition" Directive adopted June 2024
   - National law deadline: July 31, 2026 (monitor for updates)

### Cultural/Market Preferences

1. **Trust Signals**: Dutch consumers value transparency. Clear policies, visible contact info, and professional design are critical.

2. **Language**: While many Dutch speak English, native-language content builds trust. Consider NL translations for policies and FAQ in v1.x if data shows Dutch-language search traffic.

3. **Payment Methods**: Shopify checkout likely handles this, but verify iDEAL support (dominant in NL).

4. **VAT Display**: Prices must include VAT for consumers (already handled in existing pricing).

## Content Requirements (Structure vs. Copy)

This milestone focuses on **structure-first**: page shells, data flow, SEO foundation. Content writing is separate.

| Feature | Structure Needed | Content Needed | Source |
|---------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Homepage | Hero section, product highlights, trust badges, CTA layout | Headlines, product descriptions, value prop copy | Content writer / stakeholder |
| Cart page | Item list, summary, upsell slot, trust elements (return policy link) | Trust messaging, CTA copy | Minimal - mostly UI labels |
| Thank you page | Order summary, next steps, optional upsell/account creation | Thank you message, next steps copy, upsell offer | Content writer |
| Privacy policy | Sections: data collected, usage, retention, sharing, rights | Full legal copy | Legal template + customization |
| Terms & conditions | Sections: usage rights, liabilities, disputes, jurisdiction | Full legal copy | Legal template + customization |
| Shipping/returns | NL 14-day law, exceptions, process, costs | Policy details, timelines, costs | Stakeholder (business rules) |
| Contact page | Form fields, business info display, hours | Contact methods, hours of operation | Stakeholder |
| FAQ | Category structure, Q&A template, schema markup | 10-15 Q&A pairs based on real customer questions | Stakeholder + customer service data |
| Blog listing | Post card layout, pagination/filtering | N/A (no posts yet) | N/A |
| Blog post | MDX/CMS template, SEO meta, related posts | Individual articles | Content writer (post-launch) |
| SEO meta | Metadata API integration, templates | Title + description per page type | SEO copywriter or templates |

**For this milestone**: Implement structure and placeholder copy. Stakeholder provides final policy/FAQ copy before launch. Blog posts are post-milestone.

## Competitor Feature Analysis

Based on research of small European custom product e-commerce sites:

| Feature | Common Implementation | Our Approach |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| Homepage | Product imagery, self-segmentation (by room/use), trust badges, clear CTA | Same - hero with value prop, product highlights, self-segmentation if multiple categories emerge |
| Cart | Mix of overlay-only and dedicated page. Upsells common. | Both overlay (existing) + dedicated page for review/upsells |
| Thank you | Order details + account creation prompt or discount for next order | Order details + next steps. Defer upsells to v1.2. |
| Policies | Footer links to dedicated pages. Often templated. | Footer links. Use GDPR/NL templates with customization. |
| FAQ | Accordion UI, category-organized, FAQ schema | Same. 10-15 questions covering sizing, shipping, returns, care. |
| Blog | Mix of educational (how-to) and product-related content | Structure now, content later. Focus on custom textile topics (measuring, care, design ideas). |
| SEO | Basic meta tags common. JSON-LD less common for small sites. | Start with meta/OG (P1), add JSON-LD for product pages (P2). |
| Contact | Form + email. Some add phone, live chat. | Form + email. No phone/chat yet (low volume expected). |

## SEO Implementation Details (Next.js 15 Specific)

### Metadata API Usage

**Static pages** (policies, contact, FAQ):
```typescript
// app/privacy/page.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Privacy Policy | [Brand]',
  description: 'How we collect and protect your data...',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Privacy Policy | [Brand]',
    description: 'How we collect and protect your data...',
  }
}
```

**Dynamic pages** (blog posts, product variants if implemented):
```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return {
    title: `${post.title} | [Brand] Blog`,
    description: post.excerpt,
    openGraph: {
      title: post.title,
      description: post.excerpt,
      images: [{ url: post.ogImage }],
    }
  }
}
```

### Sitemap Generation

Next.js can generate programmatically:
```typescript
// app/sitemap.ts
export default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {
  return [
    { url: 'https://[domain]', lastModified: new Date() },
    { url: 'https://[domain]/cart', lastModified: new Date() },
    { url: 'https://[domain]/faq', lastModified: new Date() },
    // ... all static pages
    // ... dynamic blog posts fetched from CMS
  ]
}
```

### JSON-LD Implementation (P2 - Post-launch)

Manual component approach:
```typescript
// components/structured-data.tsx
export function ProductSchema({ product }) {
  const schema = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": product.name,
    "description": product.description,
    "offers": {
      "@type": "Offer",
      "price": product.price,
      "priceCurrency": "EUR",
      "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
    }
  }
  return (
    <script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }} />
  )
}
```

Include in page:
```typescript
// app/product/page.tsx
export default function ProductPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <ProductSchema product={productData} />
      {/* rest of page */}
    </>
  )
}
```

### Performance Notes

- Use React `cache()` to memoize data fetches for metadata and page rendering (avoid duplicate queries)
- Server Components automatically server-render metadata (SEO-friendly)
- OG image generation with `ImageResponse` supports flexbox only (no Grid)
