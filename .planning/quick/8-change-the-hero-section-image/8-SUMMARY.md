# Quick Task 8: Change the hero section image

## What Changed
Replaced the single hero image with a bento-style 2-column image grid collage featuring all 4 product photos.

## Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Replaced single image with bento grid layout

## Layout
- **Left column:** Living room transparent blind (tall) + Kitchen transparent blind (short)
- **Right column (offset):** Bedroom blackout blind (short) + Kitchen beige blind (tall)
- Rounded corners, gap between cards, right column offset with `pt-12` for visual interest
- Mobile layout unchanged (background image with overlay)
